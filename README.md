## 📊 Project Overview

This project focuses on analyzing a comprehensive dataset related to sleep disorders. The dataset includes various attributes such as sleep duration, quality of sleep, physical activity levels, stress levels, BMI categories, and more. By leveraging powerful data analysis and visualization tools, we aim to uncover patterns, correlations, and insights that can help in understanding and managing sleep disorders better.

Additionally, a **Flask-based web application** has been developed to provide an interactive platform for users to explore the data and predictions with ease.
